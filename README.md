# ðŸ“Š Telco Customer Churn Prediction  

This project focuses on building and evaluating machine learning models to predict *customer churn* using the *Telco Customer Churn dataset*.  
By predicting churn, telecom companies can identify customers at risk of leaving and take proactive actions to improve retention.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview  

- *Step 1:* Data Preprocessing (handling missing values, encoding, scaling).  
- *Step 2:* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).  
- *Step 3:* Model Building & Evaluation  
  - Logistic Regression  
  - Decision Tree  
  - Random Forest  
  - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)  
  - XGBoost  
  - Support Vector Classifier (SVC)  
- *Step 4:* Model Comparison  
- *Step 5:* Hyperparameter Tuning (GridSearchCV for XGBoost).  
- *Step 6:* Final Model Evaluation.

## ðŸš€ Results  

- Best model: *Optimized XGBoost*  
- *Accuracy:* ~80%  
- *ROC-AUC:* ~0.85  
- Strong balance between precision and recall, making it suitable for business use in churn prediction.

## ðŸ“ˆ Future Work  

- Feature engineering to create new predictive features.  
- Apply advanced class balancing (SMOTE/ADASYN).  
- Try ensemble/stacking methods.  
- Explore deep learning models (Neural Networks, LSTMs).  
- Deployment as a dashboard or REST API for real-time prediction.
